# Project for the academic course "Distributed Systems" 2016-2017 (ECE NTUA )

## Description

Implementation using *Java* of an emulator for a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), a simplified version of Chord protocol.

The main functions implemented in this DHT are: </br>
:arrow_forward: initial creation of server nodes </br>
:arrow_forward: insert/delete (key,value) pairs </br>
:arrow_forward: communication between nodes using sockets </br>
:arrow_forward: ring routing based on Chord protocol </br>
:arrow_forward: node insertion(join) and deletion(depart) (dynamically while DHT is running) </br>
:arrow_forward: replication of the data stored in the DHT with 2 types of consistency: linearizability (chain replication) and eventual </br>
:arrow_forward: creation of client nodes for making queries  </br>
